# SoulCollector
Arcade fishing game I made in Unity my last semester at college.
I made this game to learn more about how to use unity and to just help myself get better at programming in general.

If you want to download it and play just download the "SoulCollectorV0.12.4" file from the repository.
If you run the "Soul Collector.exe" after downloading the entire file it should allow you to play.
If you want to open this in Unity, you need to download the entire repository and put it in one file where your other Unity projects are located. Mine was in Users/<Whatever your username is>/<Project Name> but this could vary.
